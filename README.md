## Test Structure

## Speaking Time Tracker

The core feature that tracks speaking time during court proceedings with production-ready reliability.

### Key Capabilities
- **Real-time Tracking**: Seamless transitions between speakers with stopwatch precision
- **Party Management**: Default parties (State, Defense, Court) with ability to add custom parties
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Percentages, segment counts, averages, and silence time
- **Visual Reports**: Interactive pie charts using Chart.js
- **Detailed Timeline**: Complete chronological record of all speaking segments
- **Export Options**: Save reports as text files with full hearing details

### Usage Workflow
1. **Import Hearings**: Upload CSV with columns: Case Number, Client Name, Division, Time
2. **Start Tracking**: Click party buttons to track who is speaking
3. **Real-time Updates**: See time accumulation and current speaker status
4. **Add Parties**: Dynamically add witnesses, attorneys, or other participants
5. **Generate Reports**: View statistics, pie charts, and detailed timelines
6. **Export Data**: Download comprehensive reports with all timing data

## Mocking Strategy

Since this is a browser-based application that relies on Web APIs, extensive mocking is used:

- **MediaRecorder API**: Mocked for recording functionality
- **FileReader API**: Mocked for CSV file processing
- **navigator.mediaDevices**: Mocked for microphone access
- **URL.createObjectURL**: Mocked for file downloads
- **Blob constructor**: Mocked for file creation

## Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests only
npm test -- --testPathPattern="utils"

# Run component tests only
npm test -- --testPathPattern="components"

# Run integration tests only
npm test -- --testPathPattern="integration"

# Run tests for specific file
npm test csvParser.test.js

# Run comprehensive speaking time tracker tests
node test-speaking-tracker-final.js

# Run specific speaking time tracker test suites
npm test speakingTimeTracker.test.js
npm test speakingTimeTracker.integration.test.js
npm test speakingTimeTracker.errorHandling.test.js
```

## Test Development Guidelines

When adding new tests:

1. **Follow the existing structure**: Organize tests by utility/component
2. **Use descriptive test names**: Clearly describe what is being tested
3. **Mock external dependencies**: Keep tests isolated and predictable
4. **Test error scenarios**: Include both success and failure cases
5. **Verify user interactions**: Test actual user workflows
6. **Maintain coverage**: Ensure new code is properly tested

## Architecture & Technical Details

### Single-File Design
- **Main Application**: `court_reporter.html` - Complete standalone application
- **No Dependencies**: Runs offline once loaded, uses CDN for React and Chart.js
- **Local Processing**: All audio, transcripts, and timing data processed locally
- **Privacy-First**: No external API calls or data transmission

### Speaking Time Tracker Implementation
- **Real-time State Management**: Tracks current speaker, timing, and transitions
- **Immutable State Updates**: Uses functional programming patterns for reliability
- **Performance Optimized**: Handles rapid speaker changes without performance degradation
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized for long hearings with extensive data
- **Browser APIs**: Uses Date.now() for precise timing measurements

### Data Structures
```javascript
// Speaking time state structure
{
  parties: { [partyName]: { totalTime: number, segments: array } },
  currentSpeaker: string | null,
  hearingStartTime: timestamp,
  hearingEndTime: timestamp,
  timeline: array,
  isActive: boolean
}
```

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD environments and provide:
- **Fast feedback** on code changes (100% test success rate)
- **Comprehensive coverage** reporting across all features
- **Cross-platform compatibility** for different operating systems
- **Automated regression testing** with detailed error reporting
- **Performance benchmarks** for speaking time tracker operations
- **Production readiness validation** before deployment
