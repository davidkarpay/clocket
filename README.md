## Mocking Strategy

Since this is a browser-based application that relies on Web APIs, extensive mocking is used:

- **MediaRecorder API**: Mocked for recording functionality
- **FileReader API**: Mocked for CSV file processing
- **navigator.mediaDevices**: Mocked for microphone access
- **URL.createObjectURL**: Mocked for file downloads
- **Blob constructor**: Mocked for file creation

## Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests only
npm test -- --testPathPattern="utils"

# Run component tests only
npm test -- --testPathPattern="components"

# Run integration tests only
npm test -- --testPathPattern="integration"

# Run tests for specific file
npm test csvParser.test.js

# Run comprehensive speaking time tracker tests
node test-speaking-tracker-final.js

# Run comprehensive deposition mode tests
node test-deposition-mode.js

# Run specific speaking time tracker test suites
npm test speakingTimeTracker.test.js
npm test speakingTimeTracker.integration.test.js
npm test speakingTimeTracker.errorHandling.test.js

# Run deposition mode component tests
npm test DepositionMode.test.js
```

## Test Development Guidelines

When adding new tests:

1. **Follow the existing structure**: Organize tests by utility/component
2. **Use descriptive test names**: Clearly describe what is being tested
3. **Mock external dependencies**: Keep tests isolated and predictable
4. **Test error scenarios**: Include both success and failure cases
5. **Verify user interactions**: Test actual user workflows
6. **Maintain coverage**: Ensure new code is properly tested

## Architecture & Technical Details

### Single-File Design
- **Main Application**: `index.html` - Complete standalone application
- **No Dependencies**: Runs offline once loaded, uses CDN for React and Chart.js
- **Local Processing**: All audio, transcripts, and timing data processed locally
- **Privacy-First**: No external API calls or data transmission

### Speaking Time Tracker Implementation
- **Real-time State Management**: Tracks current speaker, timing, and transitions
- **Immutable State Updates**: Uses functional programming patterns for reliability
- **Performance Optimized**: Handles rapid speaker changes without performance degradation
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized for long hearings with extensive data
- **Browser APIs**: Uses Date.now() for precise timing measurements

### Data Structures
```javascript
// Speaking time state structure
{
  parties: { [partyName]: { totalTime: number, segments: array } },
  currentSpeaker: string | null,
  hearingStartTime: timestamp,
  hearingEndTime: timestamp,
  timeline: array,
  isActive: boolean
}
```
