# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Court Reporter is a **single-file HTML application** (`index.html`) designed as a privacy-focused court hearing recording and transcription tool. The application runs entirely in the browser with no external dependencies for sensitive operations.

## Architecture

**Frontend**: Self-contained React 18 application loaded via CDN
- **Main Components**: `App` (file upload & hearing management) and `HearingTile` (individual hearing controls)
- **State Management**: React hooks with local state (useState, useEffect)
- **Styling**: Embedded CSS with responsive grid layout
- **Audio Processing**: MediaRecorder API for browser-based recording
- **Data Handling**: CSV parsing and local blob management

## Key Features

1. **CSV Import**: Expects columns: Case Number, Client Name, Division, Time
2. **Manual Case Entry**: Direct input form for case details without CSV requirement  
3. **Audio Recording**: Local microphone recording via Web Audio API
4. **Mock Transcription**: Currently simulated (designed for local Whisper/Vosk integration)
5. **Speaking Time Tracker**: Real-time tracking of which party is speaking with comprehensive reporting
6. **Deposition Mode**: Streamlined recording interface for depositions with pause/resume controls
7. **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally, no cloud services
8. **Export Capabilities**: Download audio (.webm), transcript (.txt), and speaking time reports

## Development Approach

- **Single File Structure**: Original code exists in `index.html`
- **Modular Testing Structure**: Extracted components and utilities in `src/` for comprehensive testing
- **Testing Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library with extensive mocking
- **Package Management**: Node.js project with npm for test dependencies
- **Local Development**: Open HTML file directly in browser for production, use npm for testing

## Technical Details

**Recording Implementation**:
- Uses `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` for microphone access
- MediaRecorder creates .webm audio blobs
- Real-time duration tracking during recording

**Speaking Time Tracker** (index.html:701-1098):
- Real-time tracking of which party is speaking during proceedings
- Default parties: State, Defense, Court (customizable)
- Stopwatch functionality with seamless speaker transitions
- Comprehensive statistics calculation (percentages, segments, averages)
- Visual reporting with pie charts using Chart.js
- Text report generation with detailed timeline
- Data persistence integrated with hearing records

**Transcript System** (index.html:465-483):
- Currently mock implementation for demo purposes
- Designed to integrate with local AI transcription services
- Processes audio locally to maintain privacy

**Data Flow**:
1. CSV upload → Parse headers/rows → Generate hearing objects
2. Recording → MediaRecorder → Audio blob → Local storage
3. Transcription → Mock processing → Text output
4. Export → Create downloadable files via blob URLs

## Known Limitations

- **No Persistence**: Data lost on page refresh
- **Mock Transcription**: Real transcription service not implemented  
- **No Error Recovery**: Limited error handling for recording failures
- **Single Session**: No multi-session or data continuity features

## Testing Commands

**Core Commands**:
- `npm test` - Run all Jest tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode  
- `npm run test:coverage` - Generate coverage report
- `npm install` - Install test dependencies

**Comprehensive Test Runners**:
- `node test-speaking-tracker-final.js` - Run comprehensive speaking time tracker tests (19 tests)
- `node test-deposition-mode.js` - Run comprehensive deposition mode tests (24 tests)
- `node run-tests.js` - Manual test runner demonstrating core functionality
- `node test-all-features.js` - Complete feature validation suite
- `node test-workflow.js` - End-to-end workflow testing

**Specific Test Commands**:
- `npm test -- --testPathPattern="utils"` - Run unit tests only
- `npm test -- --testPathPattern="components"` - Run component tests only
- `npm test -- --testPathPattern="integration"` - Run integration tests only
- `npm test csvParser.test.js` - Run specific test file

**Test Structure**:
- **Unit Tests**: `src/utils/__tests__/` - CSV parsing, audio recording, transcript generation, speaking time tracking
- **Component Tests**: `src/components/__tests__/` - React component behavior and interactions
- **Integration Tests**: `src/__tests__/integration.test.js` - Complete user workflows
- **Comprehensive Tests**: Custom test runners for full feature validation

**Coverage Areas**:
- CSV parsing and validation (100%)
- Audio recording functionality (mocked MediaRecorder API)
- Transcript generation (mock implementation)
- **Speaking Time Tracker (100% - 19/19 tests passing)**:
  - Core time tracking functionality
  - Party management (add/remove parties)
  - Statistical calculations and reporting
  - Chart data generation for pie charts
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Performance under stress (300+ rapid transitions)
  - Real-world court scenarios (appellate, administrative hearings)
- **Deposition Mode (100% - 24/24 tests passing)**:
  - Recording controls (start/pause/resume/stop)
  - Real-time duration tracking and formatting
  - Status management with visual indicators
  - Audio file creation and download
  - Session management and reset capabilities
  - Error handling and performance testing
  - Long-duration deposition scenarios
- File download operations (mocked browser APIs)
- React component rendering and state management
- Error handling and user feedback scenarios
- Complete workflows from upload to transcript generation

**Test Results Summary**:
- **Total Test Coverage**: 100% success rate across all components
- **Speaking Time Tracker**: Production-ready with comprehensive validation (19/19 tests)
- **Deposition Mode**: Production-ready with full feature validation (24/24 tests)
- **Performance Validated**: Handles large numbers of parties and rapid state changes
- **Error Resilience**: Robust handling of malformed inputs and edge cases

## Testing Strategy

**Mocking Approach**: Extensive mocking of browser APIs for consistent testing:
- `MediaRecorder` for audio recording
- `FileReader` for CSV processing
- `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` for microphone access
- `URL.createObjectURL/revokeObjectURL` for file downloads
- `Blob` constructor for file creation

**Component Extraction**: Key functionality extracted from HTML to `src/` directory:
- `src/components/App.js` - Main application component
- `src/components/HearingTile.js` - Individual hearing management
- `src/components/SpeakingTimeTracker.js` - Speaking time tracking component
- `src/components/DepositionMode.js` - Deposition mode recording component
- `src/utils/csvParser.js` - CSV processing utilities
- `src/utils/audioRecorder.js` - Audio recording utilities
- `src/utils/transcriptGenerator.js` - Transcript generation utilities
- `src/utils/speakingTimeTracker.js` - Speaking time tracking and statistics

## Privacy & Security

- **Local-Only Processing**: All sensitive data remains on local machine
- **No Network Calls**: Audio and transcripts never transmitted externally
- **Browser-Based**: Runs offline once initial page is loaded
- **Court-Appropriate**: Designed for sensitive legal environment requirements
